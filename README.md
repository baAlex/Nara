Nara
====

The terrain in the screenshots should work as an overworld for an action rpg, but is more a renderer that a videogame.

Check implemented features and future work in the [projects tab](https://github.com/baAlex/Nara/projects/). And while I always try to maintain the code in a compilable state, prepare yourself to found broken things, debug messages/graphics and incomplete functionality all over the place.

Any help is welcomed ‚õ∞Ô∏èüìêÔ∏è!.
