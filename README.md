Nara
====

The terrain in the screenshots should work as an overworld for an RPG, but currently this project is more a renderer than a videogame.

Eventually Nara's goal is to recreate the experience of 90's RPGs (fixing all tedious corners), taking inspiration from the *Final Fantasy* franchise, and *Squaresoft* and *Game Arts* games.

Check implemented features and future work in [Projects](https://github.com/baAlex/Nara/projects/). And while I always try to maintain the code in a compilable state, prepare yourself to found broken things, debug messages/graphics and incomplete functionality all over the place.

Any help is welcomed ‚õ∞Ô∏èüìêÔ∏è... oh, and 'Nara' is a codename!.

Dependencies
------------
At runtime Nara requires:
 - Portaudio
 - GLFW3

For compilation:
 - Python3
 - Cmake

On Ubuntu you can install all dependencies with:
```
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev portaudio19-dev python3 cmake
```

And don't forget the `git submodule` steps when cloning the repo.


Compilation
-----------
To clone and compile the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/baAlex/Nara.git
cd Nara
git submodule init
git submodule update

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Optionally you can compile a debug build with:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
